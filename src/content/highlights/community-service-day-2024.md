Our cadets spent a meaningful day serving the local community, demonstrating the Boys' Brigade commitment to service. They volunteered at community centers, helped serve meals to the elderly, and organized recreational activities for children.

## Activities

- Meal preparation and service for 100+ seniors
- Games and activities with local children
- Facility cleaning and maintenance
- Donation drive for essential supplies

The day reinforced the importance of giving back and making a positive impact in our community.
